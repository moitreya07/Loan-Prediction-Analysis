**Objective of this group assignment:**

1. **Business Problem:** We are going to create a Machine Learning model which will be competent to predict the capability of a person to apply for a financial loan based on the various feature attributes.

2. **Data Description:** We require a dataset containing the details of loan taker(s) which will actually be needed to train our technically built model in order to understand the above-mentioned business problem in depth so that we can test it further on some real time scenario to gather the expected result.
The details of the data description are shown as follows:
    * Quantitative Attributes (ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term)
    * Categorical Attributes (Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, Credit_History, Property_Area, Loan_Status)

3. **Data Source:** From Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)

4. **Details of Analytical Tasks Performed:** At the initial part of the analysis, we have performed data cleaning, encoding and several visualization techniques on the existing dataset for better understanding. Also, we have used the anomally detection algorithm to find out any possible anomally and after that, we have performed classification over our cleansed data to find out the expected outcome.
